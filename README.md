# Zoe resources

Here are the resources that made me adopt Zoe... and write a [chocolatey package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zoe/) to help Windows collaborators install it easier :

- [Dedicated Medium article](https://medium.com/adevinta-tech-blog/zoe-the-kafka-cli-for-humans-3e01584d0d3f)
- The [Dedicated KataCoda Course](https://www.katacoda.com/wlezzar/courses/zoe)
- Of course [official GH repo](https://github.com/adevinta/zoe)
- [Zoe's Official website](https://adevinta.github.io/zoe/)

Hopefully you'll enjoy this tools as much as I do.


# Zoe install on Windows

Now, the install process on windows is as easy as :

```
sdk install java
choco install zoe

**NB : Ths section explains how to release new zoe versions.**

The whole chocolatey process has been automated, hence, releaing a new version requires very vew efforts :

1. Change targte version in `zoe.properties`
2. Push the commit to the master branch to see if it builds the right way : [check Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/adriens/chocolatey-zoe) badge for that
3. To push the release to chocolatey, simply create a release on this GH repo and wait for [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/adriens/chocolatey-zoe) to end
4. Let chocolatey moderation do the job, and update the progress on the [release pipe project](https://github.com/adriens/chocolatey-zoe/projects/1)
5. On each choco moderation step, {keep the issue up-to-date](https://github.com/adriens/chocolatey-zoe/issues/2) so you keep track of the moderation processs
